Playing with a drum set
In this application there’s a few keys images that represents different drums in a typical drum set. When you click in any of these images/buttons you get the corresponding sound of that drum. In addition, you can also use the keys in the keyboard. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88725082/174637060-767973f0-18be-4e4a-b045-7bde656f5a37.png)
